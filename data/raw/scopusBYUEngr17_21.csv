People supervising these systems often rely on information relayed by the system to make any decisions, which places a burden on the system to self-assess its proficiency and communicate the relevant information. Proficiency self-assessment benefits from an understanding of how well the models and decision mechanisms used by robot align with the world and a problem holder’s goals. This paper makes three contributions: (1) Identifying the importance of goal, system, and environment for proficiency assessment; (2) Completing the phrase “proficient ‹preposition›” using an understanding of proficiency span; and (3) Proposing the proficiency dependency graph to represent causal relationships that contribute to failures, which highlights how one can reason about their own proficiency given alterations in goal, system, and environment. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Environment; Goal(s); Intelligent agents; Proficiency; Self-assessment; System","Drones; Human engineering; Intelligent systems; Real time systems; Security of data; Autonomous systems; Causal relationships; Decision mechanism; Dependency graphs; Real-time application; Self assessment; Social robots",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088238482

A relevant question in control engineering education is: How to close the gap between theory and practice? Once subjects are introduced in theoretical classes, students want to know about its practical use. Thus, it is important to introduce theoretical control concepts with practical experiments, enabling students to easily test and validate the theory. An Arduino based temperature control laboratory (TCLab) is deployed in this study as a portable kit providing students with a simple and effective means to test some feedback control techniques.

Structural DSE of turbomachinery compressor blades is often challenging because the large number of design variables make it difficult to learn the effect that each variable has upon the stress contours. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the stress contours is used as a way to understand how the stress contours change over the design space. Two methods are introduced to address the challenge of understanding how the stress changes over a large number of variables. First, a two-point correlation is applied to relate the design variables to the scores of each principal component. Second, a coupling of the stress and coordinate location of each node in PCA is developed which also indicates how the stress variations relate to geometric variations. These provide insight to how design variables influence the stress. It is shown how these methods use PCA as DSE tools to better explore the structural design space of compressor blades. Better DSE can improve compressor blades and the computational cost needed for their design.

While there is significant research regarding user motivation on dating apps such as Bumble, Tinder, and Match.com, there is no published research that discusses the motivations of Mutual app users. Developed as a dating app to target members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Mutual allows users to find potential mates who share their religious background and specify their relationship readiness (from “Into Dating I Guess” to “Ready for a Ring”). This research aims to illuminate the various motivations, attitudes, and opinions of Mutual app users through Q methodology, which identifies perceptual groups among homogeneous populations through a factor analysis of participants’ agreement with similar statements regarding Mutual use. Findings indicated four factor groups: the Relationship Readies (i.e., those serious about dating), the Swipeaholics (i.e., those looking for entertainment), the Faithless (i.e., those who felt pressured to use Mutual), and the Eligible Optimists (i.e., those who saw the app as a convenient, entertaining way to date). Different from other research on dating apps, this study indicates that people may use a niche religion-focused dating app to find individuals with similar moral values or due to external pressure from others.

This, in turn, is making feasible new tools such as immersive, collaborative, design environments that reflect the collaborative environment of drafting tables while still providing all the power of modern, computer-based, design tools. However, before such an environment can be fully realized, basic issues surrounding collaboration in VR such as cybersickness and disorientation must be more fully addressed. This work presents the results of an experimental study conducted to characterize the trade-offs between different styles of transitioning collaborators to a shared view in an immersive virtual environment. The experimental task consisted of asking participants to identify in which quadrant of the car specific components were located. Quadrant identification was performed after a participant's virtual location was transitioned to a shared view location focused on the component to identify. The study was conducted with 45 participants who provided 1890 transition response datapoints. Analysis of these results suggests that, in many cases, collaborators are willing to experience some mild cybersickness in order to reduce their disorientation and improve both confidence and accuracy of component location identification. The results also support the recommendation that the best practice is to provide support for multiple transition styles and allow collaborators to select their preference. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Collaboration; Cybersickness; Immersive; Spatial awareness; Viewpoint; Viewpoint sharing; Virtual Reality","Economic and social effects; Location; Collaborative environments; Design environment; Immersive virtual environments; Immersive virtual reality; Location identification; Multiple transitions; Specific component; View locations; Virtual reality",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85091196229

Current industrial methods generally utilize monoethanolamine for CO2 capture; however, the CO2 regeneration requires a high temperature and energy demand during every adsorption/desorption process, along with material losses. Many solid amines with high capture capacity and stability are developed as adsorbents to overcome the limitations. However, the environmental impacts caused by adsorbents themselves are not holistically considered and discussed; meanwhile, material syntheses and consumptions are also associated with CO2 emission. To determine the environmental impacts and identify hotspots of novel CO2 capture adsorbents, two carbon nanotube supported polyethyleneimine, physically adsorbed and covalently bonded, were compared with traditional monoethanolamine method using life cycle assessment. The carbon payback periods were also analyzed to gain understanding on whether the currently evaluated novel materials are suitable for industrial application. Results suggest that, material usage, especially carbon nanotubes, contributes the majority of the overall environmental impacts for both types of carbon nanotube supported polyethyleneimine. Meanwhile, their carbon payback periods are over 40 times longer than monoethanolamine during the synthesis phase. However, the energy consumption of physically adsorbed polyethyleneimine saves up to 60% compared to monoethanolamine in every adsorption/desorption cycle due to its lower heat capacity. In addition, the rate of cumulative CO2 remission for carbon nanotube supported polyethyleneimine is twice higher than monoethanolamine, indicating the potential application for industrial CO2 capture. Overall, our study indicates that current status of solid amine has a potential in CO2 capture, but requires much improvements.

The process remains to be implemented on a wide scale in the automotive and aerospace industries, partially due to the relatively short number of welds producible by a toolset, prior to needing cleaning. In the following work, an investigation was conducted to better understand this limitation. First, the effective tool life of a steel toolset was quantified. Experiments showed that less than 60 consecutive welds could be made before the toolset seized and required cleaning. To better understand the conditions contributing so such a short tool life, thermocouples were used in subsequent experiments, to measure the temperatures achieved at various locations in the weld. Peak weld temperature increased with longer cycle times and decreased with shorter cycle times. During the experiments, it was noted that weld temperatures in excess of 500 °C were observed at weld center. At these high temperatures, the authors anticipate that intermetallic compounds (IMCs) are able to grow on tool surfaces. A rough, existing model of IMC growth in an Fe-Al system predicted IMC growth on the same order of magnitude of the tool clearances, supporting the anticipation that IMC growth is a factor in the observed, short tool life between cleanings. Following this analysis, future evaluation of less re-active tool materials is recommended. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","FSpW; Refill friction stir spot welding; RFSSW; Temperature; Tool life","Aerospace industry; Aluminum alloys; Aluminum coated steel; Automotive industry; Cleaning; Spot welding; Thermocouples; Tool steel; Welds; Effective tool; Friction stir spot welding; High temperature; Steel tools; Thin sheet; Tool materials; Tool surfaces; Weld temperature; Friction stir welding",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090035826

In this paper, we investigate the specific fabric deformation and failure mechanisms that cause observed events in the FBG measured strain behavior and the FBG spectral profile throughout the impact event. For these experiments, the standard clay backing material was replaced with a 20% clear ballistic gel to provide visual access to the back-face. The test specimen was impacted by an 8.24 g steel ball bearing travelling at 248.8 m/s, during which strain was calculated from the measured full spectrum response of the FBG using a high-speed optical interrogation system. The strain response was compared to the BFD of the Kevlar sample. The BFD was measured through the clear ballistic gel using two high speed cameras recording at 100,000 fps. The results from these tests can be used for future testing using a non-transparent backing material to obtain a detailed strain–time history, back-face deformation history and an understanding of the time sequence of physical energy dissipation mechanisms in the fabric. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Fiber Bragg Grating; High speed measurements; Optical fiber sensors","Armor; Ballistics; Deformation; Energy dissipation; Failure (mechanical); High speed cameras; Backing materials; Ballistic fabric; Fabric deformations; Face deformations; Optical interrogation; Spectral profile; Strain behaviors; Strain response; Fiber Bragg gratings",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090033354

The accuracy of computed solutions over coarse meshes, that have highly non-interpolatory control meshes, is achieved through the application of a continuous rotational approach. The starting point of the formulation is the modified Hellinger–Reissner variational principle with independent displacement, membrane, and shear strains as the unknown fields. To overcome locking, the strain variables are interpolated with lower-order spline bases while the variations of the strain variables are interpolated with the corresponding Bézier dual bases. Leveraging the orthogonality property of the Bézier dual basis, the strain variables are condensed out of the system with only a slight increase in the bandwidth of the resulting linear system. The condensed approach preserves the accuracy of the non-condensed mixed approach but with fewer degrees of freedom.

Organizations may emphasize these priorities through various forms of performance feedback. However, the impacts of using feedback to emphasize speed, quality, and quantity remain unclear in production settings. This study employs controlled laboratory experiments to examine the impact of real-time feedback on production quantities, first time yield percentages, and rework percentages. Drawing on concepts from speed-accuracy tradeoffs, we study four types of feedback: speed, accuracy, joint speed and accuracy, and yields. Laboratory activities focus on the repetitive task of converting paper-based medical records to electronic data formats. These tasks are critical inputs to data analytics and are similar in nature to simple independent manufacturing and service tasks. We study feedback effects in a setting critical to practice but rarely studied in research, where workers are incentivized for both speed and quality as they perform production tasks that explicitly allow rework. The results show that production yields worsen under speed feedback but improve under each form of quality-containing feedback. Results also show that each form of quality-containing feedback increases the proportion of correctly reworked to produced errors through different mechanisms of increased error fixing, decreased error production, or both. © 2020 Production and Operations Management Society","performance feedback; production yields; quality-speed tradeoffs; rework; speed-accuracy tradeoffs",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088566580

In this work, an experimental prototype of this concept is realized and its performance is analyzed. In particular, we demonstrate the capability of maintaining a spacecraft component at a desired operating temperature through the expansion and contraction of a collapsible radiator to control radiative heat loss. Four aluminum panels are connected via a flexible hinge constructed from interwoven copper wires and suspended from an actuating framework. The radiator panels are connected to a heated aluminum block. The radiator is placed in a vacuum environment with cooled surroundings (173 K) and the total radiative cooling power is determined as a function of radiator actuation position for a constant aluminum block temperature. As the radiator actuates from extended to collapsed, the heat transfer decreases and the fin efficiency increases. For a limited actuation range, the four-panel radiator exhibits a turn-down ratio (largest cooling power / smallest cooling power) of 1.31. A numerical model validated in this work predicts a turn-down ratio of 2.27 for actuation over the full range of radiator positions in surroundings at 4 K. Future revisions that exhibit an increase in panel and hinge thermal conductivities and utilizing eight panels would yield a turn-down ratio of 6.01.
